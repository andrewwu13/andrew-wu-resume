# Andrew Wu's Resumes

This repository contains my resumes built using RenderCV, a YAML-based resume/CV framework that allows for clean versioning, easy customization, and reproducible PDF outputs.

If you're a recruiter/hiring team, welcome! 
I currently maintain multiple specialized resumes tailored to different roles, and I’m always happy to chat more about my experiences and projects.

I'm actively seeking Summer 2026 internship/coop opportunities, so feel free to reach out if you think there might be a good fit

## Repo structure:
- `fullstack/` : reusume focused on full-stack and software engineering roles
- `datascience-ai/` : reusume focused on data science, AI, and ML/DL roles
- `*yaml` : RenderCV configuraion and content files

## Building the Resume Locally
If you'd like to generate the resume yourself:

`
git clone https://github.com/andrewwu13/andrew-wu-resume
`

`
cd andrew-wu-resume
pip install rendercv
`

`
rendercv render
`

This will generate a PDF using the configuration defined in the YAML files.

## About RenderCV
